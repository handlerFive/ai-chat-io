## Model Providers

This is a template and it ships with OpenAI `gpt-4o` as the default. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.


## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. Do rename the (.env.example) to (.env.local)

> Caution: Don't expose your secret keys with .env

1. Clone the repo
2. Run a docker image of Postgres locally or get one from Neon - We are intrested in the URL for DB Connection (put it in .env.example). Modify the .env file with updated POSTGRES_URL - should look something like this if Postgres is running locally -

```POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://postgres:<your_password>@localhost:5432/postgres(Default DB Name)``` 
3. Run Migrate Command to set up the DB

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm drizzle-kit migrate #migration command
```

Your ai-chat-bot should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
